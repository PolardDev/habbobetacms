# habbobetacms
Content Management System for Habbo Retros.
Thank you for your confidence.
You have the CMS in hand, now all you have to do is install it.
For this, you just have to follow our steps one by one and you will be all set.

1. Import the contents of the habbowms/main folder into your FTP root (without the SQL.sql file).
2. Open the file (config.php) in order to modify the information such as the name, url of your Habbo server then in the file (app/class/HabboDatabase.php) in order to modify the connection information to the database .
3. Import the file (SQL.sql) into your database then insert the database of your emulator (Arcturus Emulator).
4. Access your Habbo server and make yourself an account, this will be your main account, then get a rank.
5. Enjoy using your CMS.

The steps that concern (SWFS, Emulator, Nitro) are not supported by HabboCMS, so you have to turn to forums and/or to the owners of these resources.

If you have a question, do not hesitate to contact us on our Discord server in the section (Help Center).
